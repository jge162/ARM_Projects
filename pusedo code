pusedo code 

First need to create a main.c
Link to asm_main
Create asm_main in assembly to run loop and P1in and Out
Create loop code so we can compare if switches are pushed or not
Create code to turn off the LED
Create code to turn on the LED
Configure pins for GPIO
Make pins output sw1 and sw2
Enable pull-up and pull resistors for p1.1 and p1.4
Next create code for GPIO_inputs
Need code for p1.1 and p1.4
Code is lastly ran for proof of concept and done.
